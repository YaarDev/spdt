Problem Statement: University Student & Event Management System

The university wants a software system to manage students, their participation in various events,
and their performance/results in a single program. The system should be able to:

1) Register Students
    Each student has: roll number, name, age, and contact info (phone, email).
    Students can participate in multiple events (cultural, sports, technical).

2) Store Event Information
    Each event has a name, type, maximum marks, and score obtained by each participant.

3) Record Performance
    For each student, track marks for every event.
    Students may only have one type of score per event (either sports score OR cultural score).

4) Operations to Perform
    - Add new students and event details.
    - Compute total marks, average, and grade for each student.
    - Rank students by total marks.
    - Search for a student by roll number.
    - Print a leaderboard with student names, total marks, and grades.

5) String Operations
    Names and event names should allow operations like concatenation, reverse, comparison.

6) Dynamic Decisions
    Decide how to organize students and event data efficiently.
    Decide which data types to use for marks, scores, and grades.
    Decide where to use typedef, enum, or union.
